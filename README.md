# Welcome on Be Stars Ha Line Classfication

** Automatic classication of Be Stars Ha Line profil with Fasai.**


Synopsis: The objective of this algorithm is to use Deep Learning on a set of Be star spectra in order to derive an automatic classification of the line profiles. The Halpha line profiles described here are based on the coding implemented by V. Desnoux (see document "codage_profil.pdf").

## Introduction

This Notebook trains a Halpha line profile classification model from Be star spectra. The data used to train this model come exclusively from the [Base BeSS](http://basebe.obspm.fr/basebe/Accueil.php?flag_lang=fr)<sup>1</sup>. A special thanks to all the contributors of this base and to the people who maintain it should be noted here, for the possible use of all these data.

The retrieval of data to build a dataset is explained in another document (link).

The process of preparing the data for training, as well as the training steps, are described before each run cell in this notebook.



The training of this model is done with the library [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)<sup>2</sup>, based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) <sup>3</sup>.
